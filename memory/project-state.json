    "Build a tiny reverse-proxy website that serves DuckDuckGo only.\n\nRequirements:\n- Use Node.js with NO external packages (only built-in http/https).\n- Create a server file (server.js) that listens on process.env.PORT (fallback 8080).\n- For every incoming request, forward the same method, path, query string, and body to https://duckduckgo.com.\n- Set the upstream Host header to duckduckgo.com.\n- Stream the upstream response back to the client (status, headers, body).\n- Do NOT allow proxying to any other domain (hardcode duckduckgo.com).\n- Add basic error handling (return 502 on upstream error).\n- Deploy it as a web service so visiting / shows DuckDuckGo and /?q=test performs a search.\n\nOptional (nice-to-have):\n- If the upstream sends a Location header pointing to https://duckduckgo.com/..., rewrite it to a relative path so redirects stay inside the proxy."
